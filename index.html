        <h4>A Little Bit About BusMall</h4>
        <p>BusMall was born from the idea of SkyMall, users have a long commute on city buses, the creators of BusMall grew bored on their hour(s) long bus rides. They began using their phones to shop online because of how fast that passed the time, however it cost them a lot of their data usage. One day they remembered being a child on an airplane and how exciting it was to shop in the catalogs that the plane provided. With those memories BusMall was born, somewhere people could shop while on long bus rides and not waste the data of their phones!</p>
